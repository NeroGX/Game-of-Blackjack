            <p>Hello, welcome to the wonderful world of Blackjack!
                Come in, come in. We're gonna have some fun. But first,
                we need to let some ground rules. I know, I know, some of yall
                know how to play Blackjack. But this isn't for you. For everyone
                else, here's some ground rules:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your first ace usually equals 11. If you start to bust,
                    the ace turns into 1.
                </li>
                <li>All subsequent aces equal 1.</li>
                <li>Face value cards equal ten.</li>
                <li>Every other card equals their number value</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>The goal is simple. You and the dealer starts with 2 cards.
                The dealer's hand is always invisible unless you hit "I'll stay."
                You want to either get to 21 points or beat the dealer in cards.
                You can do this by saying "Hit me." When you hit "I'll stay,"
                the dealer reveals his hand and gets to draw cards until his
                total is above 16. If you beat the dealer hand, you win, else,
                you lose. Simple as that.
            </p>
            <p>
                One more thing. If you hit 21, you got blackjack and game is over.
                If you want to restart your game, gotta hit the Time warp button. 
                Otherwise, ta-ta for now.
            </p>
